WAVE and Undumag
==================================

WAVE
-------------------------

WAVE is a fortran software written by Michael Scheer which allows the calculation of spectra generated by (relativistic) electrons traveling through a magnetic field. With WAVE you can specify a magnetic field - either along the beam axis or as a full field-map and the position and sice of a screens on which to calculate spectral flux densities or distributions, Stoke vectors and power distributions and more. Beam properties can also be taken into account - energy spread, emittance effects and bunch properties. In order to calculate the spectral properties, WAVE tracks the electrons through the magnetic field and numerically solves the general radiation equation (!!! - find good name, citation). The resulting spectrum is then convoluted with a gaussian energy distribution and with the beam emittance to generate the resulting spectrum.

Undumag
-------------------------

Undumag is a software package - developed mainly in Fortran - by Michael Scheer, which allows for the calculation of magnetic field maps generated by - almost - arbitrary geometric distributions of magnetic materials - permanent magnets or ferromagnets. Such magnetic systems undergo a non-linear process of magnetic relaxation - the highly magnetizable ferromagnets will be magnetized in the fields generated by the permanent magnets, or by current carrying coils, and their magnetic fields will then influence the other ferro- and permanent magnets in their vicinity. The process by which this system settles into a magnetic equilibrium is called magnetic relaxation. Undumag performs the relaxation and then allows for the calculation of the resulting fields. Field integrals and forces on arbitrary volumes inside the system can also be calculated.

Purpose
-------------------------
Unduwave is a wrapper for WAVE and Undumag which makes the underlying functionality - or at least part of it - available for easy integration in python environments.
