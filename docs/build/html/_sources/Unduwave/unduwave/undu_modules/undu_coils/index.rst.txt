.. py:class:: undu_coils(coils, api=None)

   
   A container class containing a list of coil objects which are to be created and simulated with Undumag.
   :param list coils: A list of coil objects.
   :param api: The undu_api object carrying out the simulations.
   :type api: undu_api or None


   .. py:method:: move_it(vec)

      Moving the center of the coil by vector vec.

      :param list vec: A list containing the (x,y,z) components of the translation vector vec.



   .. py:method:: add_to_clc()

      Add all daughter coils to the Undumag clc file for simulation.



   .. py:method:: set_all_apis()

      Sets all daughter coil-api objects to the api object of this collection.



.. py:class:: coil(coil_type, current, center_coords, normal_vec, rot_angle, length, inner_z, outer_z, inner_radius, height, n_vert, n_hor, n_rad, filling=None, n_windings=None, api=None)

   
   Coil class representing a currect carrying coil.
   :param str coil_type: The type of coil. Can be one of the following: 

           Rectangular: A coil with 90Â° edges. 

           RectWindings: A coil with rounded edges. 

   :param float current: The current in the coil [mA]
   :param undu_magnets.point_coords center_coords: The 3 center coordinates. [mm]
   :param undu_magnets.point_coords normal_vec: Normal vector. The opening in the middle of the coil lies perpendicular to normal_vec. A normal_vec along (0,1,0) is the standard to which the parameter names refer!
   :param float rot_angle: angle by which coil is rotated aroung normal_vec?
   :param float length: Extension in x-direction. [mm]
   :param float inner_z: Extension in z-direction of hole inside coil. [mm]
   :param float outer_z: Extension in z-direction of full coil. The difference of outer and inner z determines the width of the coils running around the central hole. [mm]
   :param float inner_radius: The inner radius of the curvature of the coil edges. [mm]
   :param float height: The extent of the coil in y-direction. [mm]
   :param float n_vert,n_hor,n_rad: Number of segmentations.
   :param filling: The percentage of the cross-section of the coil being filled with current carrying wire
   :type filling: float or None
   :param int n_windings: The number of coils in a cross-section
   :type n_windings: int or None
   :param api: The undu_api object carrying out the simulations.
   :type api: undu_api or None


   .. py:method:: set_api(api)

      Setting the internal api if it is not None

      :param undu_api api: The api object.



   .. py:method:: add_to_clc()

      Gets the clc-text for this coil and adds it to the api._prog_paras.in_file_clc_lines list.
      The in_file_clc_lines lines object can be initialized or, if empty, will be initialized via the api.



   .. py:method:: move_it(vec)

      Translates the center of the voil by the vector vec. 

      :param undu_magnets.point_coords vec: The translation vector.



   .. py:method:: create_clc_txt()

      Creates the actual clc text from the object's parameters

      :return list: The list containing str representing the content of the undumag clc file
