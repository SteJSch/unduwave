.. py:class:: undu_api(undu_mode='from_clc_file')

   
   Undumag API-class for controlling basic undumag-functionality. 

   :param str undu_mode: Determines the basic mode by which a magnet structure is
   constructed. Can be one of the following: 

                   'from_clc_file': The magnet structure is read from an Undumag .clc file. 

                   'from_undu_magns': A model of the magnet structure is constructed using 
                   the undu_magns classes. 



   .. py:method:: run()

      Runs undumag with the given settings, prepares and postprocesses data.



   .. py:method:: load_clc_raw()

      Loads a raw-clc file template from the folder set in prog_paras.in_file_folder+prog_paras.in_file_clc_raw.
      After loading prog_paras.in_file_clc_lines holds the list representation of the file in form of a list of strings.



   .. py:method:: set_force_calc(object)

      Prepares the parameter list for calculation of force on the undu_magnets object object.

      :param undu_magnets object: An undu_magnets object (i.e. a collection of magnets) on which the force is to be calculated.



   .. py:method:: get_results()

      Returns the results from a given simulation as result-object.
